In this project, a novel approach to perform 3D pointcloud object inpainting while leveraging Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to repair incomplete 3D pointclouds was developed. When fine tuned, the proposed model can potentially be applied to solve complex real-world problems in autonomous driving and city mapping.\
Top project grade awarded.
