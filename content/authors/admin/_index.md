I am currently a Masters student researcher at CERLab, proudly advised by Professor Kenji Shimada. I will complete my Master of Science degree in Meche at Carnegie Mellon University in the upcoming Spring, with specialization in 3D computer vision and deep neural network. My current research focus on Machine Learning, Pointcloud Processing and 2D Computer Vision with Graph Neural Networks. Ultimately, I am interested in developing algorithms that enable remote sensing of hard to reach sites. 

I obtained my Bachelors of Applied Science in Mechanical Engineering with dual minors in Robotics and Biomedical Engineering. I have spent two summers working at CIGITI Lab in University of Toronto where I was advised by Professor James Drake and Dr. Thomas Looi on the design of bipolar cauterization forceps for Da Vinci Robot. I also spent a summer at Shanghai Jiao Tong University where I was advised by Professor Xingguo Ming on IOT integrated smart business process framework.
